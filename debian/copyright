License: CC-BY-NC-SA-2.5
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
 PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
 OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
 LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
 HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
 encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with
 a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
 themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
 Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
 the purposes of this License.
 "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
 pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
 fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
 abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
 transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective
 Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
 For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
 recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
 image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
 this License.
 "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
 of this License.
 "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
 "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
 of this License.
 "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who
 has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
 Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
 rights under this License despite a previous violation.
 "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
 selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution,
 Noncommercial, ShareAlike.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
 restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
 the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
    to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
    Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
    to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
    and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work
    including as incorporated in Collective Works;
    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
    and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative
    Works;
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
 or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
 reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(e)
 and 4(f).
 .
 4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
    You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
    must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License
    with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
    publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
    any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
    the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not
    sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
    License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
    publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work
    with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
    manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
    require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to
    the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from
    any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective
    Work any credit as required by clause 4(d), as requested. If You create a
    Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
    clause 4(d), as requested.
    You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a
    later version of this License with the same License Elements as this
    License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same
    License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike
    2.5 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
    for, this License or other license specified in the previous sentence with
    every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
    display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer
    or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms
    of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder,
    and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
    disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
    perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any
    technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
    inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to
    the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
    require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
    subject to the terms of this License.
    You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in
    any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
    advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for
    other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall
    not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage
    or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any
    monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
    If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
    perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
    intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
    medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
    pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author
    and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor
    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's
    copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of
    such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent
    reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
    Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in
    the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
    the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
    Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such
    credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
    in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such
    credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and
    in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
    credit.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
    Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the
    exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
    rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
    performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if
    that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
    advantage or private monetary compensation.
    Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the
    exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights
    agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
    phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute,
    subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the
    US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
    distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed
    toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
    Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where
    the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
    collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
    SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
    of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
    of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
    public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward
    commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
 CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
 LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
    who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this
    License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
    individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
    Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
    Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
    on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.
    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
    the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
    written agreement of the Licensor and You.
